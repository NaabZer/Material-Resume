# TDDD27 Project
# Material Resume
------
### Functional Specifiation
The aim of this project is to create an interactive webb app in which one can create resumes with a [material design](https://material.io/design/), using a drag and drop interface and then export to a PDF.
The app will be divided into "two" parts; one which you will be able to edit and style your resume, and another one where you are able to add different entries (work experiences, project, soft/hard skills etc.) which you can reuse for several resumes. To keep track of both the entries and resumes an account can be created to store these values in a backend with a database.

It would also be nice if possible to integrate Linkedin's OAuth, and import the entries available on ones profile from Linkedin.

### Technological Specfication

#### Front-end Framework
The front-end will be created using the React/Redux combo.

#### Back-end Framework
The back-end will be created using Django using a PostgreSQL database.
